# Safespaces

This is the development / prototyping environment for 'Safespaces', a 3D/VR
desktop environment for the Arcan display server.

Note that this is a highly experimental young project. Prolonged use is quite
likely unhealthy in a number of ways, eye strain guaranteed while debugging.
Tread carefully and try with non-VR device profiles first. Keep a vomit-bucket
nearby.

The project and related development is discussed in the #arcan IRC channel on
the freenode IRC network. **Note** the development of the scripts herein are
mainly done as part of the 'vrviewer' tool (durden/tools/vrviewer in the
source tree) [Durden](https://github.com/letoram/durden) and only mirrored
and tracked here in "release bursts" when there are are things to synch.

## Setting up

NOTE - For running 'natively' (no X etc.) on Linux systems, stick to kernels
that are <= 4.14 for the time being, some change in 4.15 broke the support
for scanout on VR displays.

You can start simply with:

    arcan /path/to/safespaces

Or for specifying profiles other than those labeled as 'default' with:

    arcan /path/to/safespaces space=spacename device=devicename

The space profile match to the corresponding spacename (.lua) in the spaces/
subfolder which defines environment layout, visuals, workflow and input
response. The device profile controls how the rendering pipe will be
configured. There are a few default device presets to chose from:

* basic - takes whatever the arcan vr bridge provides as the default
* monoscopic - normal "3D" with mouse and keyboard
* psvr - waits for a PSVR HMD display to appear before activating
* rift - used for oculus rift
* simulated - works like monoscopic but outputs with a faked profile

The next section, configuration, goes into detail on how these can be extended
or complemented.

# Configuration

The config.lua file determines the reserved meta keys, reported client display
properties, font and so on. The configuration is further split up into the
(empty) default autorun.lua, the command-line controllable device profile and
the currently active 'Space'.

## Spaces

A space is simply a synchronized set of activated command paths that follow a
/path/to/command or /path/to/key=value for non-binary settings.  The full set
of possible such paths are covered in API.md, including the option to load
other spaces (with no protection against recursion, mind you). Every window
management option and interaction model will be provided in this way,
optionally via a mountable filesystem to make it easier to discover.

# Devices

The device profile determines rendering mode, target output and input devices,
arguments to the VR device bridge and possible overrides for properties such
as oversampling and distortion parameters, along with device- specific input
bindings. Note that any collisions between bindings defined for a device vs.
bindings defined for the global config will be biased in favor of the global
config and a warning printed to stdout for each collision.

The list if device- configuration fields are as follows:

    -- example.lua
		return {
			display = '^MYDEV', -- full lua string matching pattern
      oversample_w = 1.0, -- composition buffer width * display width
			oversample_h = 1.0, -- composition buffer height * display height
			distortion_model = 'basic', -- basic (OpenHMD universal shader or none)
      width = 1024, -- display width in pixels
			height = 512, -- display height in pixels
			center = 0.001, -- vertical center in meters
      grab = false, -- disable window mode input grab
			horizontal =

		bindings = {
		["k"] = "/path/from/API.md"
		}
		}

## In- use Configuration

Though the config.lua (+ whatever device and space specific bindings that you
use) specify the different active keybindings, there are some that are
particularly important to know about.

hmd/reset : default bound to meta+F5, this will define your
current viewing angle as your default 'staring comfortably
forward' position. This can be used to reorient yourself and to
work around drift in the orientation sensor tracking.

hmd/step\_ipd=0.1 or -0.1 : default bound to meta+F9,meta+F10, and is used to
change the virtual relative eye distance.

## Troubleshooting

There are a number of moving parts that can go wrong here, depending on the
lower details of your system. For VR use, always make sure that the HMD itself
is working via OpenHMD and their simple text examples first. Then make sure
that your user actually has access to the input and output devices that you
wish to use.

The next big part (for VR use) is the presence of the 'arcan\_vr' binary. Not
only do you have to build it manually (arcan git repository, tools/vrbridge)
but you also have to set the path to it in the arcan configuration database,
see the README.md for the vrbridge tool on details for that.

## Device Specific Notes

For Oculus Rift CV1 (and possibly others), the display doesn't register as such
immediately. It may be necessary to take the headset on and off a few times
before it actually appears as a new display.
